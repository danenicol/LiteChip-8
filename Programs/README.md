This Folder contains sample programs that you can run the LiteChip-8. Obviously to code these programs into the RAM, you need to follow operation instructions in the documentation and make sure that instructions and hexadecimal data is converted into binary. 
Because there is a 1111 RAM LIMIT, meaning 16 different memory locations holding 1 byte each, your programs cannot be over 16 lines long. This creates a significant bottleneck with the microprocessor. Despite the binary display being able to output a number as large as 256, the fibonacci sequence program only goes up to 5. In later versions the RAM size will be changed.
